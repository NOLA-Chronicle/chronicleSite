					<p id="purpose">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many people know the internet is a vast source of knowledge. People can use it to communicate with others over long distances to exchange knowledge and experiences with others. One example is within the scientific community; Scientists can research and experiment on different things at completely opposite ends of the Earth, and place their findings on the internet for anyone to see, such as other scientists to compare their findings and discover new theories. This website is similar in the fact that it is an experiment. Later in the page there is a button; Anyone who visits this website will be able to click the button, but only once. The goal is to see how far this site will "travel" to get as many people as possible to press the button. I guess this site is most similar to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geocaching.com/guide/">geocache</a>, a global GPS "Hide-and-Seek" or treasure hunt type game.</p>
